# Lua Obfuscator

Compile Lua source to bytecode.

Put your Lua files into sources directory, and run Obfuscate.bat. The lua files will be compiled to bytecode.

Note: this bytecode will only work on your platform (Windows, OSX, Linux) and on that specific architecture ( x86, x86_64, ARM ).

While this tool may obfuscate the code, a veteran programmer will be able to reverse engeineer the code.
